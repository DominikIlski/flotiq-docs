# Content Objects

Once a Content Type has been defined in the system - the user can create Content Objects of that Content Type. This is done either directly through the API or via the convenient Content Entry tools provided within the Content Management Platform.

## Authoring content

The Content Entry component of the system consists of 2 elements - content browser and the content editor.

To quickly browse and search through large amounts of data, the content browser provides a convenient grid interface that can be customized according to users preferences:

From the grid, the users can go to the form that allows them to edit particular Content Objects:

The form view also displays the information about historical versions of a particular Content Object. From this view you can also switch to older revisions.
