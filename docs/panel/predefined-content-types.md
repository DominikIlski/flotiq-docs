If you don't have any Content Type Definitions (CTD) yet, you see tiles with predefined CTDs from which you can choose your first one by clicking on the tile representing your chosen CTD.

Custom tile opens empty CTD.

If you already have at least one CTD you can use the dropdown menu on the top right corner to add more predefined CTDs.
