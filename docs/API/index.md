# API access

## API Key
There are 2 API keys - read-write and read-only, which can be retrieved from the user profile page in the Flotiq UI:

![](images/user-profile.png){: style="height:150px;"}

then simply copy your API key from the form field:

![](images/api-keys.png){: style="height:150px;"}

As a best practice we recommend you use the Read Only API key whenever possible and only switch to the RW key in case you need to upload or modify existing content.
