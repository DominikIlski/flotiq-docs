# Flotiq CLI

## Overview

We've prepared Flotiq CLI to start GatsbyJS projects with Flotiq integration event faster than before. 

You can now clone gatsby starter, install dependencies, import data to Flotiq, and start the project with [exactly one command](./starting-new-project.md).

You can also import data more straightforward if you already cloned the gatsby starter repository with [import data command](./importing-data.md).

## Installation

You need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) in version 9 or higher to install and use Flotiq CLI.

To install it use:

`npm install -g flotiq-cli`

It installs CLI globally.
